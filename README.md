1. Fat Arrow Function



## ğŸ‘‰ Fat Arrow Function
- A simple function in javascript is:
```
function name(){
  return "John";
  }
console.log(name());
```

- In modern javascript we can code the above function in this way:
```
let name = () => {
  return "John";
  }
console.log(name());
```

- However, we can reduce the lines in our code by removing the brackets, ```{}``` if there is only one statement to execute.
```
let name = () => "John";
console.log(name());
```
```ğŸ’¡ Note than we have also removed the ```return``` statement since we have only one return statement. ```
